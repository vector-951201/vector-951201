## 52 Open Source Projects in 52 Weeks
<a href="https://github.com/onamfc/52-for-52"><img src="https://dpt3aqeyfpth5.cloudfront.net/img/52-for-52-logo.png" style="height:200px;"></a>

Over the next year, I'm building and releasing 52 open source projects in 52 weeks. Why?

- Because consistency beats intensity.
- Because I believe in building in public.
- And because I want to give back to the dev community that's given me so much.

This isn’t about launching the next unicorn.
It’s about solving real problems, building momentum, and sharing what I learn along the way.

Each week, I’ll:
- Launch a new open source repo
- Share a short write-up on how it works
- Post lessons learned on GitHub and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/brandon-estrella-dev)
